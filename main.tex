% Welcome, Math for Math's sake folks!
%
% My idea is to use this file way to share solutions
% questions, and comments.
%
% Feel free to edit any part of it, and add
% ``Your name:your comment, question, or solution'' so we know
% who is asking what.
%
% You don't have to worry too much about making mistakes in LaTeX
% format: ShareLatex keeps track of the file's history, so it's pretty
% easy to fix mistakes.  There's help here if you want to learn LaTeX
% and ShareLatex: https://www.sharelatex.com/learn
%
% If you're a techy person, this is also linked to a github repo
% here: https://github.com/mkoconnor/Math-for-Math-s-Sake-Logic-chapters-5-6-7-and-maybe-8
% Feel free to submit a pull request.  If you've never heard of github,
% just ignore this paragraph
%
% This is a total experiment, and I'm not sure if will people will
% like or use it, but let's find out!
